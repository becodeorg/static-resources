# static-ressources

A "dumb" repo published on Github Pages to put static files, like images, we need for exercises or whatever.

This is a private repository only viewable and editable by Becode coaches on Github but all its content is published on Github Pages and is, indeed, completely public.

To access a file you put in this repo just use the URL `https://becodeorg.github.io/static-ressources/<ressource path>`.
