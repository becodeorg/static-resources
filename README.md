# static-ressources

A "dumb" repo published on Github Pages to put static files, like images, we need for exercises or whatever.

This is a private repository only viewable and editable by Becode coaches on Github but all its content is published on Github Pages. So take care to only publish stuff if you are 100% sure you want it to be fully public.

To access a file you put in this repo just use the URL `https://becodeorg.github.io/static-ressources/<ressource path>`.
