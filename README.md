# BeCode: static-ressources

> ⚙️ Host for _static files_ at BeCode

* * *

A "dumb" repo published on Github Pages to put static files, like images, we need for exercises or whatever.

## About

This is a private repository only viewable and editable by Becode coaches on Github but all its content is published on Github Pages. So take care to only publish stuff if you are 100% sure you want it to be fully public.

## Usage

Also, **never modify, move, change, replace or delete anything in this repo**. You have no way to know if some ressource is used or not. Just add new content. And try to not put too big files or Github will give us a phone call saying we're abusing (true story).

To access a file you put in this repo just use the URL `https://static.becode.xyz/<ressource path>`.
